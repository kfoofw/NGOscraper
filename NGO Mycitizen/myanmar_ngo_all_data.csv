The renewed fighting in Kachin State in 2011/2012 and the slow response by the international community brought the group – back then many of them were simply private donors – together in an effort to join forces to alleviate the suffering caused to the thousands of innocent civilians affected by the conflict.The diverse background and wide-range of technical expertise of the core group has provided MDCG with a unique multi-ethnic and multi-sectoral make-up and a sound programming foundation. Most members of the founding group and the current staff have years of experience working in humanitarian and development programs in rural Myanmar at grass-roots level. Their work and program conception are guided by humanitarian principles, rights based approach, international norms and standards, and well adapted to local context and culture. MDCG staff comprises of a well-balanced pool of experienced social workers with community development experiences from several years of working with INGOs and/or LNGOs, and retired persons of government departments with extensive networks and financial management skills. The diversity and strong professional competences of staff has helped MDCG to gain momentum and to transition from a low profile CBO to a full profile NGO.While saving lives and alleviating immediate suffering are first priority of MDCG intervention, MDCG recognizes the urgent need for more advanced and sustainable development in remote villages, especially in ethnic minority areas that have been neglected for so many decades. So, to achieve highest impact of recovery, MDCG aims to accompany all relief efforts with livelihoods and infrastructure rehabilitation in integrated fashion. MDCG staff is dedicated to help people in these remote areas and challenging environments and therefore are principally based in the field. Similar to CBOs, MDCG field staff work through community networks (women’s associations, volunteer groups, VDC, etc) to strengthen their capacity and community ownership of the project.

AAPTIP will operate at both regional and national levels. It will provide support to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), working with the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC), regional anti-human trafficking bodies and individual partner countries.Human trafficking is the illegal trading of human beings for the purpose of labour, sexual and other forms of exploitation. It is a crime that can occur within a country or across national borders. Trafficking contravenes fundamental human rights, denying basic and broadly accepted individual freedoms to women, men and children all over the world. It has wide economic, social and political impacts, and has serious consequences for development in South East Asia.Diverse but integrated responses are needed to effectively combat human trafficking through prevention, prosecution and protection. Since 2003, Australia has invested more than $50 million across these three approaches.
