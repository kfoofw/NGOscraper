# NGOscraper
Web scraper scripts for NGO listings on regional aggregator websites

This repo stores the documentation on my learning journey to create Python scripts to webscrape data from NGOs aggregator websites. 

The main package used was "BeautifulSoup" and the scripts were configured to compile critical information such as NGOs title, mission 
objectives, target demographics, year of establishment, etc.

This project was a starting tool for me to learn about Webscraping and HTML, as well as writing reproducible Python code.
